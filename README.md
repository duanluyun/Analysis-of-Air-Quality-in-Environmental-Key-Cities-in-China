# Analysis of Air Quality in Environmental Key Cities in China
Air is a condition for human beings and living things to live, so clean air is particularly important for people. However, in recent years, with the development of industry and transportation industry in China, a lot of pollutants have been discharged into the air, and the air quality is getting worse and worse. The air quality problem is also more and more concerned by the government and the public. In this work, the air quality data of Beijing,Chengdu and Guangzhou in China Statistical Yearbook of 2017 were selected, and the statistical analysis was carried out by using Spark,Elasticsearch and Kibana software.
